Just put .txt files in to input tags
launch .bat file
take your tags in output folder
Tags that are listed in unwanted_tags.txt will be removed from prompt, feel free to add and remove any you want
Repeating tags like "shirt" and "white shirt" will be filtered, and simpler variations will be removed. Similar complexity and varied tags will not be touched.

It will not take care of duplicate tags.
It it supposed to work with underscores in unwanted tags, but i don't think i did it same way for input, so, replace all underscores with space in Dataset tag editor first just in case.


--------NEW--------
Wanted tags
Launch wanted tags, and ONLY tags specified in respective text files will be left in your dataset.


Please, backup yout text files in case anything goes wrong.
